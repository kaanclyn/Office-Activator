# Office Activator

The Office Activator is a simple batch script tool designed to help users activate Microsoft Office 2019 products, such as Microsoft Office Standard 2019 and Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019, without the need for purchasing an official license. The tool connects to public Key Management Service (KMS) servers to activate the software automatically.

## Key Features
